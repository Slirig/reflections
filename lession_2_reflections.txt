What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It will create a .git folder that is hidden, this folder will hold all the
informations for commits that have happend inside the folder. So that i can go back in time or check what changes have happend to the files. IF i dont do this it will not be a repository and git will have no functions att all on the folder.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an invisible area that will hold the files for a commit, while working directory hold all the files and the repository hold controlls of the files. It offers me the the chance to see what files will be added in a commit before i commit it, this will make me ablo to regret files i dont wont and add other files that i forget.
