When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository over a local when there is a lot of people involved in the project or 
when i would want to get the content of the repository to other computers and only not mine. With this
a mean in situation were i maybe change computers often and want every computer have access to the same files
and work on the same stuff
