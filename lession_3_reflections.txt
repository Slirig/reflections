When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository over a local when there is a lot of people involved in the project or  when i would want to get the content of the repository to other computers and only not mine. With this a mean in situation were i maybe change computers often and want every computer have access to the same files and work on the same stuff


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

if it automaticallt pull all the time, all the changes i have done in my local repository will be delitet and all the work i did was for nothing.
It can also be bacouse i have made changes to funtions that other ppl have made changes 
to also, and it will overwrite my changes that i have made.
